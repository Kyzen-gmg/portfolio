# Italics and Bold

We'll start by learning two basic elements in text formatting: italics and bold. In these lessons, you'll notice some formatted red text; this text is actually written in Markdown! Regular Markdown doesn't look any different than regular text, but we're providing some highlighting to make it easier to see.

To make a phrase italic in Markdown, you can surround words with an underscore (_ ). For example, _this_ word would become italic.

For this next lesson, make the word "not" italic.
```
Writing in Markdown is **not** that hard!
```

Similarly, to make phrases bold in Markdown, you can surround words with two asterisks ( ** ). This will **really** get your point across.

In the box below, make the word "will" bold.
```
I **will** complete these lessons!
```

Of course, you can use _both italics and bold_ in the same line. You can also span them **across multiple words**.

In the box below, make the words "Of course" italic, and the words "a little moxie" bold.
```
"*Of course*," she whispered. Then, she shouted: "All I need is **a little moxie**!"
```

For the final exercise in this lesson, we're going to make some words bold and italic.

In general, it doesn't matter which order you place the asterisks or underscores. In the box below, make the words "This is unbelievable" both bold and italic. Place the asterisks **_on the outside_**, just to make it more legible.
```
If you're thinking to yourself, ***This is unbelievable***, you'd probably be right.
```
